**Leinad Shop** is a marketplace platform developed by two passionate developers, Daniel (front-end) and Reth (back-end). Our goal was to revolutionize the market, allowing creators to sell their products directly to customers while the platform took a 10% service fee for profitability. Unfortunately, due to personal issues on both ends, the project never made it to production; it remained as code. After some time, we've decided to make it public and share our vision with the world.

## Key Features

- **User Registration:** Users can sign up as creators (sellers) or customers. Creators have the ability to create products for sale.

- **Product Creation:** Creators can add detailed information about their products, including images, descriptions, prices, and available quantities.

- **Product Purchases:** Customers can browse the platform, view products, add them to the shopping cart, and complete purchases.

- **Shopping Cart:** Customers have the option to add multiple products to their shopping cart and finalize the purchase in a single transaction.

- **Payment and Service Fee:** The Leinad Shop platform automatically applies a 10% service fee to the total value of each transaction, with the remaining amount credited to the seller's account.

- **Messaging System:** The platform features a messaging system to facilitate communication between buyers and sellers.

- **Secure Payments:** We employ secure payment technologies to ensure that all transactions are safe and protected.

## Technologies Used

The Leinad Shop project was built using the following technologies:

- **TypeScript:** The programming language used both on the front-end and back-end for robust and type-safe code.

- **Docker:** Used to containerize applications and services, making deployment and environment management easier.

- **NestJS:** A scalable and modular back-end framework built with TypeScript and Node.js.

- **Jest:** A testing framework to ensure code reliability and safety.

- **MySQL and MongoDB:** Databases used to store information about users, products, and transactions.

- **RabbitMQ:** A message broker to handle real-time events and notifications.

- **Redis:** Cache storage to improve performance and scalability.
