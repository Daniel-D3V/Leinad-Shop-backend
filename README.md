# Leinad Shop Backend

**Leinad Shop Backend** is the server component of the Leinad Shop marketplace platform. It's designed to handle user registration, product management, transactions, and more. This project was developed by Reth with the goal of revolutionizing the market, but due to unforeseen circumstances, it never made it to production. After some time, we've decided to make it public and share our vision with the world.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can sign up as creators (sellers) or customers.

- **Product Management:** Creators can add detailed information about their products, including images, descriptions, prices, and available quantities.

- **Transaction Handling:** The platform automatically applies a 10% service fee to each transaction.

- **Messaging System:** A messaging system facilitates communication between buyers and sellers.

## Technologies Used

The Leinad Shop Backend was built using the following technologies:

- **TypeScript:** A statically typed language for robust code.

- **NestJS:** A scalable and modular back-end framework.

- **MySQL and MongoDB:** Databases for storing user, product, and transaction data.

- **RabbitMQ:** A message broker for handling real-time events.

- **Redis:** Cache storage for improved performance.
